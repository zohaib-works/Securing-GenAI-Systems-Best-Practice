    "| **Principle of Least Privilege** | Give the smallest key possible. Only what you NEED to do your job.          | Data scientists can see anonymized data → but NOT real customer names/phone numbers |\n",
    "| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Group people by job → give the whole group the same keys                     | Junior devs → can code new features  <br> DevSecOps → can deploy to real servers   |\n",
    "| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Password + something else (phone code, authenticator app, fingerprint)      | Even if password is stolen, hacker still can’t log in                           |\n",
    "| **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** | The big “control panel” (AWS IAM, Google Cloud IAM) that stores all rules   | They use AWS IAM to manage who can touch the chatbot servers                       |\n",
    "| **API Tokens / OAuth** **OAuth** | Special secret keys for apps (not humans)                                    | External partner app gets a token that only allows 5,000 messages per day         |\n",
    "| **Audit Logs**                | A camera that records every door opening and who did it                      | If someone tries to log in 50 times from Russia → security team gets an alert     |\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **List all job types**  \n",
    "   → Admin, Developer, Data Analyst, Customer Support, External Partner, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Roles in your IAM tool**  \n",
    "   Example roles:  \n",
    "   - `analyst-read-only` → can view dashboards  \n",
    "   - `developer-test` → can push code to test servers  \n",
    "   - `deploy-engineer` → can push to real (production) servers  \n",
    "   - `admin-full` → can do everything (only 2–3 people!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign the LEAST permissions needed**  \n",
    "   Bad: Give everyone “full access”  \n",
    "   Good: Developers can’t see real customer data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Turn on MFA for everyone** (no exceptions for admins!)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Protect APIs with tokens or OAuth**  \n",
    "   Never use usernames/passwords for machines\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Turn on logging & alerts**  \n",
    "   Get notified if:  \n",
    "   - 5 failed logins in a row  \n",
    "   - Someone logs in from a new country  \n",
    "   - Someone tries to download the whole database\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test it!**  \n",
    "   Pretend you are a hacker or curious intern → try to reach things you shouldn’t.  \n",
    "   Fix any holes you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Review every 3–6 months**  \n",
    "   When someone changes job or leaves the company → remove their access immediately.\n",
